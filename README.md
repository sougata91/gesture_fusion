This repository contains code and resources for a hand gesture recognition model based on a modified AlexNet architecture. The model leverages multi-scale feature extraction techniques (Haar Wavelet Transform and Local Phase Quantization) and incorporates a Dual Path Squeeze Attention (DPSA) mechanism to enhance feature learning from gesture images.
